# Networking - routing config

### View current routing table
```
$ route
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 h1-eth0
10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 h1-eth0
10.0.1.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 h1-eth1

```
Or
```
$ ip route

default via 10.0.0.1 dev h1-eth0
10.0.0.0/24 dev h1-eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.100
10.0.1.0/24 dev h1-eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.1.100
```

Default will route any path that's not found in the routing table via a gateway, 10.0.0.1 through device h1-eth0 interface.

Routes in range 10.0.0.0/24 will be route through h1-eth0 interface. 

So there are some terminologies here.

What is scope? 
The scope of a route in Linux is an indicator of the distance to the destination network.The scope of an IP address is an indicator of how far from the local host the address is known, which, to some extent also tells you how far the owner of that address is from the local host.

Host: An address has a host scope when it is used only to communicate within the host itself. Outside the host this address is not known and can not be used. An Example is the loopback address, 127.0.0.1

Link: An address has a link scope when it is meaningful and can be used only within a LAN. An example is a subnet's broadcast address.

Global: An address has global scope when it can be used anywhere. This is the default scope for most addresses.

What are the flags?
```
U (route is up)
H (target is a host)
G (use gateway)
R (reinstate route for dynamic routing)
D (dynamically installed by daemon or redirect)
M (modified from routing daemon or redirect)
A (installed by addrconf)
C (cache entry)
!  (reject route)

```
To enable your host acat like a router, we need to enable ip forward. 
```
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
This will be valid until next reboot, if you want it to be enabled by default, edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
```
$ vi /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```
